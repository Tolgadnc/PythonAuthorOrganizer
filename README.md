In MS word while citing sources sometimes the programme wants the user to enter the names of the authors in this spesific format: "Surname1, Name1; Surname2, Name2;..." Of course, in articles the names of the authors 
are not organized like that and organizig them as such can be time consuming if there are many authors. Thus, this programme generates that format automatically. The user only has to copy the names from the article and paste them inside the programme.
There is an .exe file inside dist folder. I also provided the python "Author_Organizer.py" code.
